Natural disasters are events or phenomena caused by natural processes that result in widespread harm to people, animals, and the environment. These events can include earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, droughts, wildfires, and volcanic eruptions. They can have serious consequences for human health, including injury, illness, and loss of life. Natural disasters are often unpredictable and can occur with little warning, making it difficult for people to prepare and respond to them effectively. 

In this project, we have mainly focussed on cyclone detection and prediction as a part of disaster management. Cyclones, also known as hurricanes or typhoons, are large-scale atmospheric systems that can cause significant damage and loss of life. Early detection and warning of cyclones is essential for disaster management and mitigation efforts. Cyclone detection is a crucial aspect of disaster management and early warning systems. Traditional methods of cyclone detection rely on ground-based observations and measurements, such as weather stations, radar, and aircraft observations. These methods are limited by the availability and accessibility of ground stations, and may not provide timely and accurate information in all cases. 

Satellite imagery offers a promising alternative for cyclone detection as it provides a wide coverage and high spatial resolution. In order to efficiently implement our project, we have studied various research papers that employed different architectures and techniques to predict cyclones in images. In this report, we have implemented a deep learning approach for detecting cyclones in satellite imagery. 

Our approach involves the use of YOLOv7 architecture model to analyze satellite images and identify the presence of cyclones. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a dataset of satellite images in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall for YOLOv7 architecture and demonstrate that it outperforms traditional methods of cyclone detection. Our approach has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of cyclone detection, enabling better preparedness and response to cyclones and other natural disasters. It can also contribute to the development of more advanced and robust deep learning approaches for satellite image analysis and other geospatial applications.
